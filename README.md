# **Machine Learning Model Implementation**

#### **Overview**  
This task focuses on implementing a **machine learning predictive model** using **Scikit-Learn** to classify or predict outcomes based on a dataset. The objective is to apply **data science and machine learning techniques** to extract meaningful insights and make accurate predictions. For this task, a **student performance dataset** has been used to predict final grades based on various influencing factors.  

By completing this task, hands-on experience is gained in **machine learning model development, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation**, which are crucial skills in artificial intelligence and data science.

### **Tools and Technologies Used**  

1. **Programming Language**  
   - **Python**: Python is used for implementing the machine learning model due to its extensive libraries and ease of use in data science.  

2. **Libraries and Frameworks**  
   - **Pandas**: For handling and manipulating datasets efficiently.  
   - **NumPy**: For numerical operations and mathematical computations.  
   - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for data visualization, helping in understanding data distribution and relationships.  
   - **Scikit-Learn**: Provides various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing tools, and model evaluation metrics.  

3. **Editor/Development Platform**  
   - **Jupyter Notebook**: The implementation and analysis have been carried out in **Jupyter Notebook**, which allows for interactive coding, visualization, and documentation within a single environment. This is widely used in data science and machine learning projects.

### **Process Followed in Jupyter Notebook**  

1. **Importing Required Libraries**  
   - The necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning are imported.  

2. **Loading the Dataset**  
   - A student performance dataset is loaded from a CSV file, using **Pandas**, ensuring proper data structure and accessibility.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - The dataset is analyzed using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to understand its structure, missing values, and statistical properties.  
   - A **histogram visualization** is created to show the distribution of final grades (`G3`).  

4. **Feature Selection and Data Preprocessing**  
   - **Unnecessary columns** are removed to improve model performance.  
   - **Categorical variables** are converted into numerical values using **Label Encoding**, making the dataset suitable for machine learning models.  

5. **Splitting Data for Training and Testing**  
   - The dataset is split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets to evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy.  

6. **Model Training**  
   - A **Linear Regression Model** is trained using Scikit-Learn to predict student grades based on input features.  

7. **Model Evaluation**  
   - The performance of the model is assessed using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.  
   - These metrics help determine how well the model predicts unseen data.
